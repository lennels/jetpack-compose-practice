## [2026-02-03] Day 6: Data Modeling & Reactive State Management

**Pathway:** Android Basics in Compose - Unit 2, Pathway 3 (Extended)
**Resources:** [Kotlin Data Classes](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/data-classes.html), [Compose State & Hoisting](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-using-state)

### 🛠️ Technical Implementation
* **Immutable Data Modeling:** Mastered the use of `data class` and the `.copy()` function. Practiced updating state by creating new instances rather than mutating existing ones.
* **Functional Collection Pipelines:** Chained operators like `.filter`, `.map`, and `.forEach`. Solved a "Type Trap" bug where I attempted to access properties after a type transformation in the pipeline.
* **Advanced Compose Components:** Integrated `TextField` for user input and `Switch` for toggling logic, linking them to reactive state.
* **State Hoisting & Architecture:** Refactored composables to be "stateless" by extracting state to a parent level. Implemented the "State Down, Events Up" pattern.

### 🧠 Key Takeaways
* **The Lead Mindset (Immutability):** Using `.copy()` is a safety requirement for financial apps like Google Wallet; it prevents race conditions and ensures the UI and Logic are never out of sync.
* **Unidirectional Data Flow (UDF):** Understood that UDF makes the code more predictable. By keeping composables stateless, they become 100% reusable and significantly easier to unit test.
* **Pipeline Awareness:** Realized the importance of tracking object types throughout a transformation stream to avoid runtime crashes.

* **LazyVerticalGrid:** Implemented a responsive grid using `GridCells.Fixed(2)` to display content in a dual-column format.
* **Composable Composition:** Combined `Card`, `Row`, and `Column` to align the topic image with its metadata.
* **Abstract & Open Classes:**
    * Used `abstract` for base classes that shouldn't be instantiated.
    * Used `open` to allow inheritance and overriding (since Kotlin classes are `final` by default).
    * Applied `protected` visibility to allow subclasses to modify internal state (e.g., `batteryLevel`) while keeping it encapsulated.

### 🧠 Key Takeaways
* **UI Specs:** Learned to translate specific design requirements (DP spacing, typography styles) into Compose Modifiers.
* **Iteration:** Practiced the workflow of building a single item component first, then populating it into a lazy layout.
* **Inheritance Logic:** Understood that abstract classes can hold state (`var`/`val`), which distinguishes them from Interfaces in Kotlin.

### 📈 Progress Tracking

* **Data Classes:** Leveraged `data class` for model layers to benefit from auto-generated `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `copy()` functions.
* **Destructuring:** Practiced destructuring declarations to unpack data class properties into separate variables efficiently (e.g., `val (name, age) = dog`).
* **OOP Inheritance Reinforcement:** * Reinforced that `abstract` classes serve as incomplete blueprints that *must* be extended.
    * Used `open` to explicitly opt-out of Kotlin's default `final` class behavior, allowing for controlled inheritance and method overriding.

### 🧠 Key Takeaways
* **Design Consistency:** Understood how to use `MaterialTheme.colorScheme.primary` instead of hardcoded hex values to maintain a professional, adaptable UI.
* **Boilerplate Reduction:** Recognized how `data classes` simplify data handling in Kotlin, making the codebase cleaner and more maintainable for large-scale projects.

## [2026-02-06] Day 9: State Management & Collection Manipulation

**Pathway:** Android Basics in Compose - Unit 3 (Custom Projects)
**Projects:** Lion City Wallet & Makan Splitter
**Kotlin Resource:** [List Transformations and Copying](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/data-classes.html#copying)

### 🛠️ Technical Implementation
* **State Hoisting & Callbacks:** Implemented state hoisting in "Makan Splitter" by moving `orderList` to the top-level Composable and passing lambda functions (`onIncrement`, `onDecrement`) down to child components.
* **Immutable State Updates:** Mastered the pattern of updating lists in Compose using `.map { ... }` combined with the `.copy()` function to create new object instances, ensuring the UI recomposes correctly.
* **Filtering Logic:** Built a dynamic filtering system for "Lion City Wallet" where selecting a card type updates the `LazyColumn` to show only relevant transactions or returns to a full list view.
* **Destructuring in Loops:** Utilized destructuring declarations within `items` blocks (e.g., `val (merchant, amount, category, card) = transaction`) to keep Composable code clean and readable.
* **Material 3 Navigation & Layouts:**
    * Implemented `CenterAlignedTopAppBar` with custom typography.
    * Used `Scaffold` to manage inner padding and layout structure.
    * Leveraged `LazyRow` for a horizontal card selector and `LazyColumn` for vertical lists.

### 🧠 Key Takeaways
* **Unidirectional Data Flow:** Reinforced the concept that state flows down (to cards) and events flow up (to the main app state), a critical architecture requirement for high-level software engineering roles.
* **Recomposition Triggers:** Learned that Compose tracks state by object identity; updating a property inside a list item requires a new list reference for the UI to "see" the change.
* **UI Flexibility:** Practiced using `Arrangement.SpaceBetween` and `fillMaxWidth()` to create professional-looking, responsive list items that mimic real-world financial apps.

### 📈 Progress Tracking
* **Time Invested:** 4 hours
* **Phase:** 1 (Kotlin Fundamentals & Android Basics)
* **Goal Alignment:** Practicing mini projects (Wallet/Splitter) to sharpen my jetpack compose skills.

## [2026-02-07] Day 10: Lifecycle, Sealed Classes & Feature Completion

**Pathway:** Android Basics in Compose - Unit 3 (Custom Projects)
**Projects:** Makan Splitter (Feature Complete)
**Kotlin Resource:** [Sealed Types - Typealias](https://typealias.com/start/kotlin-sealed-types/)

### 🛠️ Technical Implementation
* **State Management:** Finalized `orderList` logic in "Makan Splitter". Implemented `incrementQuantity` and `decrementQuantity` using `.map { ... .copy() }` to trigger UI recomposition through object identity changes.
* **Derived State & Logic:** Built a `BottomSummary` component that dynamically calculates subtotal, GST (9%), and total price using functional transformations (`filter` and `sumOf`).
* **Extension Functions:** Created a local `roundUp()` extension function for `Double` to handle currency formatting within the summary view.
* **Layout Orchestration:** Used `Scaffold` with a `weight(1f)` modifier on the `LazyColumn` to ensure the summary box stays pinned to the bottom while the list remains scrollable.

### 🧠 Key Takeaways
* **Sealed Classes/Interfaces:** Learned that sealed types represent restricted class hierarchies. Unlike Enums, subclasses can hold unique state, making them perfect for representing UI states like `Success(data)` or `Error(message)`.
* **Activity Lifecycle:** Studied the sequence of `onCreate`, `onStart`, `onResume`, `onPause`, `onStop`, and `onDestroy`. Essential for understanding how the OS handles process death and configuration changes.
* **UI Flexibility:** Mastered the use of `Shape` and `Background` modifiers to create a "Bottom Sheet" feel for the summary section, aligning with modern Fintech UI patterns.

### 📈 Progress Tracking
* **Time Invested:** 4 hours
* **Phase:** 1 (Kotlin Fundamentals & Android Basics)
* **Goal Alignment:** Completed "Makan Splitter" logic; solidified UDF
