* **Logic Integration:** Used `MutableState` and `random()` to link business logic (rolling a die) to the UI layer.
* **Lambda Refinement:** Conducted a deep-dive revision of Lambdas to understand how `onClick` handlers capture and process data.

### 🧠 Key Takeaways
* **Clean Code:** Extension functions allow for a more "Architect-level" code organization by keeping core classes slim.
* **State Awareness:** First encounter with how Compose "recomposes" or redraws the screen when data changes.

### 📈 Progress Tracking
* **Time Invested:** 5 hours
* **Phase:** 1 (Kotlin & Interactive Basics)
* **Goal Alignment:** Building logic-heavy components that react to user inputs in real-time.

## [2026-02-02] Day 5: Reactive State & Interface Contracts

**Pathway:** Android Basics in Compose - Unit 2, Pathway 3
**Resources:** [Codelab: Using State](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-using-state), [Typealias: Scopes](https://typealias.com/start/kotlin-scopes-and-scope-functions/#statement-scope), [Interfaces](https://typealias.com/start/kotlin-interfaces/)

### 🛠️ Technical Implementation
* **State Management:** Implemented the Tip Calculator app using `remember` and `mutableStateOf` to persist values across recompositions.
* **State Hoisting:** Applied "State Hoisting" patterns to move state from a composable to its caller, making components more testable and stateless.
* **Abstraction with Interfaces:** Defined `interface` contracts to decouple implementation details from the rest of the application.
* **Scope Mastery:** Analyzed statement vs. declaration scope to better understand variable visibility and memory lifecycle.

### 🧠 Key Takeaways
* **Single Source of Truth:** Learned that state should live at the highest common parent to maintain UI consistency.
* **Polymorphism:** Interfaces are the foundation of "Architect Lead" level design patterns (like Repository or Factory patterns).

### 📈 Progress Tracking
* **Time Invested:** 6 hours
* **Phase:** 1 (Architecture Foundations)
* **Goal Alignment:** Deepening knowledge of state—the most critical part of complex apps like Google Wallet.

## [2026-02-03] Day 6: Data Modeling & Reactive State Management

**Pathway:** Android Basics in Compose - Unit 2, Pathway 3 (Extended)
**Resources:** [Kotlin Data Classes](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/data-classes.html), [Compose State & Hoisting](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-using-state)

### 🛠️ Technical Implementation
* **Immutable Data Modeling:** Mastered the use of `data class` and the `.copy()` function. Practiced updating state by creating new instances rather than mutating existing ones.
* **Functional Collection Pipelines:** Chained operators like `.filter`, `.map`, and `.forEach`. Solved a "Type Trap" bug where I attempted to access properties after a type transformation in the pipeline.
* **Advanced Compose Components:** Integrated `TextField` for user input and `Switch` for toggling logic, linking them to reactive state.
* **State Hoisting & Architecture:** Refactored composables to be "stateless" by extracting state to a parent level. Implemented the "State Down, Events Up" pattern.

### 🧠 Key Takeaways
* **The Lead Mindset (Immutability):** Using `.copy()` is a safety requirement for financial apps like Google Wallet; it prevents race conditions and ensures the UI and Logic are never out of sync.
* **Unidirectional Data Flow (UDF):** Understood that UDF makes the code more predictable. By keeping composables stateless, they become 100% reusable and significantly easier to unit test.
* **Pipeline Awareness:** Realized the importance of tracking object types throughout a transformation stream to avoid runtime crashes.

### 🛠 Challenges / Bug Squash
* **Recomposition Loops:** Initially misplaced `mutableStateOf`, causing unnecessary redraws. 
* *Fix:* Hoisted the state to the caller, ensuring a single source of truth and stabilized recomposition.

### 📈 Progress Tracking
* **Time Invested:** 2 hours
* **Phase:** 1 (Architecture Foundations)
* **Goal Alignment:** Building scalable, testable UI patterns used in Singapore’s top-tier engineering teams.


## [2026-02-04] Day 7: Building Scrollable Grids & Kotlin Deep Dive

**Pathway:** Android Basics in Compose - Unit 3, Pathway 2
**Codelab:** [Practice: Build a Grid](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-practice-grid)
**Kotlin Resource:** [Abstract and Open Classes](https://typealias.com/start/kotlin-abstract-and-open-classes/)

### 🛠️ Technical Implementation
* **Lazy Layouts:** Mastered both `LazyColumn` (for the Affirmations app) and `LazyVerticalGrid` (for the Courses app).
* **Data Class Construction:** Defined a `Topic` data class to handle multi-type data (String Resource ID, Int for course count, and Drawable Resource ID).
* **LazyVerticalGrid:** Implemented a responsive grid using `GridCells.Fixed(2)` to display content in a dual-column format.
* **Composable Composition:** Combined `Card`, `Row`, and `Column` to align the topic image with its metadata.
* **Abstract & Open Classes:**
    * Used `abstract` for base classes that shouldn't be instantiated.
    * Used `open` to allow inheritance and overriding (since Kotlin classes are `final` by default).
    * Applied `protected` visibility to allow subclasses to modify internal state (e.g., `batteryLevel`) while keeping it encapsulated.

### 🧠 Key Takeaways
* **UI Specs:** Learned to translate specific design requirements (DP spacing, typography styles) into Compose Modifiers.
* **Iteration:** Practiced the workflow of building a single item component first, then populating it into a lazy layout.
* **Inheritance Logic:** Understood that abstract classes can hold state (`var`/`val`), which distinguishes them from Interfaces in Kotlin.

### 📈 Progress Tracking
* **Time Invested:** 5 hours
* **Phase:** 1 (Kotlin Fundamentals & Android Basics)
* **Goal Alignment:** Strengthening UI layout fundamentals and OO principles required for Junior/Intern roles in Singapore.
