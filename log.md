* **Immutable State Updates:** Learnt the pattern of updating lists in Compose using `.map { ... }` combined with the `.copy()` function to create new object instances, ensuring the UI recomposes correctly.
* **Filtering Logic:** Built a dynamic filtering system for "Lion City Wallet" where selecting a card type updates the `LazyColumn` to show only relevant transactions or returns to a full list view.
* **Destructuring in Loops:** Utilized destructuring declarations within `items` blocks (e.g., `val (merchant, amount, category, card) = transaction`) to keep Composable code clean and readable.
* **Material 3 Navigation & Layouts:**
    * Implemented `CenterAlignedTopAppBar` with custom typography.
    * Used `Scaffold` to manage inner padding and layout structure.
    * Leveraged `LazyRow` for a horizontal card selector and `LazyColumn` for vertical lists.

### 🧠 Key Takeaways
* **Unidirectional Data Flow:** Reinforced the concept that state flows down (to cards) and events flow up (to the main app state), a critical architecture requirement for high-level software engineering roles.
* **Recomposition Triggers:** Learned that Compose tracks state by object identity; updating a property inside a list item requires a new list reference for the UI to "see" the change.
* **UI Flexibility:** Practiced using `Arrangement.SpaceBetween` and `fillMaxWidth()` to create professional-looking, responsive list items that mimic real-world financial apps.

### 📈 Progress Tracking
* **Time Invested:** 4 hours

**Kotlin Resource:** [JUnit 4 Documentation](https://junit.org/junit4/) / [Android ViewModel Guide](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)

### 🛠️ Technical Implementation
* **ViewModel Implementation:** Explored the ViewModel as the "brain" of the app. Shifted logic away from the UI layer to handle business rules (e.g., score calculation and word validation).
* **UiState Observation:** Leveraged `StateFlow` to expose a single source of truth. The UI now acts as a passive observer of the state snapshot.
* **Unit Testing (JUnit 4):** Wrote a test suite for `GameViewModel`. 
    * Used `assertFalse` to verify error flag resets and `assertEquals` to validate scoring logic.
* **State Verification:** Focused on testing the "Happy Path"—ensuring that a correct user guess properly updates the score and transitions the state correctly.

### 🧠 Key Takeaways
* **Source of Truth:** The ViewModel survives configuration changes (like rotation) and holds the app logic, while the `UiState` describes exactly what the user sees at any given moment.
* **Testable Architecture:** Separation of concerns (Logic vs. UI) is what makes Unit Testing possible. Testing the "brain" without the "face" (UI) makes for faster, more reliable builds.
* **Naming Conventions:** Adopted the `unit_condition_expectedResult` naming pattern for test functions to ensure clarity in test reports.

### 📈 Progress Tracking
* **Time Invested:** 3 hours
* **Phase:** 1 (Kotlin Fundamentals & Android Basics)

## [2026-02-09] Day 12: Advanced State Logic & Logic-Driven ViewModels

**Pathway:** Android Basics in Compose - Unit 4 (Architecture & Testing)
**Kotlin Resource:** [State in Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/state) / [ViewModel & StateFlow](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)

### 🛠️ Technical Implementation
* **Derived State Optimization:** Learnt the use of `get()` properties in `UiState` for automatic calculations (`subtotal`, `tax`, `currentPowerUsage`, `totalProfitLoss`). This ensures the UI never performs manual math and relies on a "Single Source of Truth."
* **Immutable List Manipulation:** * Implemented item updates using `.map { if (match) copy() else it }` to ensure thread-safe state transitions and trigger Recomposition.
    * Utilized `.filter { }` for dynamic item removal while maintaining state immutability.
* **Architectural Hardening:**
    * **Conditional Guarding:** Implemented logic gates to block actions (e.g., Power Budgeting in Smart Home) before state updates occur.
    * **Qualified Returns:** Utilized `return@update` for early-exit logic to handle null safety and invalid user actions gracefully.
    * **Bulk & Multi-Property Updates:** Developed functions to update multiple objects or multiple properties within an object (e.g., `splitStock` logic halving price while doubling shares) without losing data integrity.

### 🧠 Key Takeaways
* **The "Copy" Rule:** Solidified the understanding that modifying an object's property directly (mutation) will not trigger a UI refresh. Replacing the entire state object via `copy()` is mandatory for Compose.
* **Functional Programming:** Shifted from manual iteration to functional operators like `.any`, `.sumOf`, `.count`, and `.find` for cleaner, self-documenting code.
* **Logic vs. Side Effects:** Learned to handle state changes by calculating the *next* possible state rather than modifying the current one, a core principle for high-reliability apps.

### 📈 Progress Tracking

**Kotlin Resource:** [Navigation with Compose](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/navigation) / [Type-Safe Navigation Guide](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/design/type-safety)

### 🛠️ Technical Implementation
* **Type-Safe Route Architecture:** * Pivoted from legacy String-based routing to **Kotlin Serialization**.
    * Defined routes using `@Serializable` objects for static screens (`PassList`) and `data class` for parameterized destinations (`PassDetails`).
* **Navigation Backstack Management:**
    * Learnt the use of `backStackEntry.toRoute<T>()` to unpack complex arguments without manual key-string mapping.
    * Implemented standard back-navigation using `navController.popBackStack()` to maintain a clean history.
* **Shared ViewModel Pattern:**
    * Scoped a single `PassViewModel` instance to the `NavHost` level, allowing seamless state sharing between the Wallet List and the Detail View.
    * Ensured that data modifications (e.g., "Top Up" actions) on a detail screen are immediately reflected in the parent list without result-passing boilerplate.
* **UI Resilience & Debugging:**
    * **Namespace Collision Handling:** Resolved conflicts between Route classes and Composable functions by adopting the `...Screen` suffix convention.
    * **Null-Safety Guarding:** Implemented early-exit checks for `.find` operations to handle edge cases where a navigation ID might not match the current state.
    * **Modifier Scoping:** Fixed layout "jank" caused by incorrect modifier inheritance (chaining `fillMaxSize` in nested children).

### 🧠 Key Takeaways
* **Compile-Time Safety:** Realized that Type-Safe navigation catches errors (like missing parameters) at build time, preventing the runtime crashes common in older "String-template" navigation styles.
* **Identity Separation:** Learned that the Navigation "Ticket" (the Route class) is separate from the "Destination" (the Screen Composable).
* **State Synchronization:** Solidified the understanding of a **Single Source of Truth**; when screens share a ViewModel, navigation becomes a simple lens into the same underlying data.

### 📈 Progress Tracking
* **Time Invested:** 5 hours
* **Phase:** 2 (Android Basics with Compose & Architecture)
* **Goal Alignment:** * Completed **Campus Pass Manager**
    * Successfully migrated from the official "Cupcake" tutorial logic to the 2026 industry-standard Type-Safe approach.

**Codelab:** [Practice: Navigation in Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-practice-navigation)

### 🛠️ Technical Implementation
* **Composite UI Layout:**
    * Built a **Dashboard Screen** that integrates a horizontal category filter (`LazyRow`) and a vertical transaction history (`LazyColumn`).
    * Optimized performance by nesting the `LazyRow` inside a `LazyColumn` item block, preventing the common "Infinite Height" crash associated with nested scrollable components.
* **Scaffold & Inset Mastery:**
    * Resolved issues with missing `TopAppBar` and `FloatingActionButton` by correctly hoisting the `innerPadding` from the `Scaffold` to the `NavigationHost`.
* **Robust Input Validation:**
    * Engineered a "String-First" state pattern for the **Add Transaction Screen** to solve the "decimal backspace" bug and cursor jumping.
    * Implemented numeric validation using `toDoubleOrNull()` and character filtering to prevent `NumberFormatException` crashes during text entry.
* **Component-Level Design:**
    * Utilized `FilterChip` components to manage a dynamic `Set<Category>` within the `UiState`.
    * Refactored `TransactionCard` to use `Modifier.weight()` for text wrapping, ensuring long transaction names do not push prices off-screen.

### 🧠 Key Takeaways
* **Function References (::):** Realized that using function references (e.g., `viewModel::amountTextbox`) is much cleaner than explicit lambdas; it removes the need to manually pass "it" and improves code readability.
* **String-to-Double Paradox:** Discovered that UI state for numeric inputs should remain as `Strings` to preserve "incomplete" states (like trailing decimal points), converting to numeric types only for business logic.
* **Scaffold Padding Chain:** Learned that the `innerPadding` provided by the `Scaffold` is a "contract" that must be passed all the way down to the screen-level Composables to maintain UI visibility.
* **Arrangement vs. Alignment:** Clarified the use of `Arrangement.spacedBy()` for consistent gaps and `Alignment.CenterVertically` for group positioning within containers.

### 📈 Progress Tracking
* **Time Invested:** 5 hours
* **Phase:** 2 (Android Basics with Compose & Architecture)
* **Goal Alignment:** * Successfully developed the core UI and navigation for the **Expense Tracker** practice project.

## [2026-02-12] Day 15: Navigation Architecture & Modern Date Handling

**Pathway:** Android Basics in Compose - Unit 4 (Practice Project Wrap-up)
**Codelab:** [Navigation and State Management Integration](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/design/type-safety)

### 🛠️ Technical Implementation
* **Modern Date Persistence:**
    * Shifted from legacy `java.util.Date` to **`java.time.LocalDate`** and **`Instant`**, utilizing **API Desugaring** to ensure compatibility with `minSdk 24`.
    * Implemented **Epoch Days (`Long`)** as the primary storage format for dates, optimizing memory efficiency and simplifying database sorting for future Room integration.
* **UDF Navigation Events:**
    * Engineered an **Event-based Navigation** pattern using a `LaunchedEffect` to observe a success flag (`onSuccessSubmission`) in the UI state. 
    * This decoupled the ViewModel from the `navController`, ensuring that navigation back to the Dashboard occurs only after successful business logic execution.
* **TopAppBar & Backstack Integration:**
    * Dynamically controlled the visibility of the "Back" arrow by observing `navController.currentBackStackEntryAsState()` within the Scaffold.
* **Atomic State Management:**
    * Resolved a "State Mutation Trap" by ensuring all validation errors and success flags are updated in a single `.update { ... }` block, preventing UI flickering and lost updates.

### 🧠 Key Takeaways
* **The Date Paradox:** Confirmed that `Long` (Epoch) is the "Source of Truth" for storage, while `LocalDate` is used for logic and `String` for the UI.
* **State Chaining:** Realized that `it.copy()` calls must be chained or handled collectively; independent copies within a single function result in only the last copy being preserved.

### 📈 Progress Tracking
* **Time Invested:** 3 hours
* **Phase:** 2 (Android Basics with Compose & Architecture)
* **Goal Alignment:** * Finished my mini **Expense Tracker** practice project.
